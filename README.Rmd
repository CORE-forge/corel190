The goal of corel190 is to provide a tidy interface to [L190/2021 dati.anticorruzione](https://dati.anticorruzione.it/#/l190) on ANAC platforms. Through this package, you may freely access data on anti-corruption, transparency, and public contracts managed by  ANAC in the context of its institutional activities. On their platform available data can be viewed and downloaded via the appropriate sub-sections; for example, in the section "Analytics," there is a tool for browsing and analyzing data on public contracts, while in the section "Dataset" there is a collection of open JSON, CSV, and XML files that can be downloaded for free.

The following information has been made public.

* **RPCT**: a list of those responsible for the prevention of corruption and transparency.
* **In-House**: a list of administrative and judicial bodies that operate by direct payments to their own companies (art. 192 of the D.Lgs. n. 50/2016);
* **L.190/2012**: list of permitted and elaborated communications in accordance with Art. 1, Paragraph 32 of the Legge 190/2012;
  * **Registro Comunicazioni**: the interved communications between CAs and ANAC
* **Albo Arbitri**: Arbitri Albo della Camera Arbitrale;
* **Dataset**: list of Open Data datasets published by the Authority; 
* **Analytics**: dashboard on public contracts for labor, services, and supplies.

Pkg `corel190` serves this data (previously cleaned) by simply loading i.e. `library(corel190)`  the package.
Moreover it serves a set of convenient functions to interact with **xml** data coming from **Registro Comunicazione** L190. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of corel190 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CORE-forge/corel190")
```


## ðŸ—’ todos

- add **ANAC** logo to plots.
- in-house data has too many commas to be parsed, find a smarter way.
- add insistently and possibly wrappers in vignette
- moving out open data exept fot l190, this should be made onty fror L190.
